Project Theme:
Artificial Intelligence and Education

Project Name
ClassCraft.AI (placeholder)

Problem Statement
Educators often face the time-consuming task of developing comprehensive lesson plans, tests, and quizzes, which has the potential to cut into valuable lesson time.

Solution
Our AI-powered web application, ClassCraft.AI, automates these time-consuming tasks, allowing educators to focus on fostering student growth and success. This online platform provides educators with generative tools to create lesson plans for various time frames (yearly, monthly, or weekly) as well as tests and quizzes tailored to the content taught.

Note: The application generates templates and guidelines for lesson plans, tests, and quizzes—offering ideas rather than fully developed assessments—so that educators can customize content to meet specific needs and challenges.

Scope of Application
With the integration of the Gemini AI API, the application can support the creation of educational content across a wide range of curriculums and subjects, emphasizing those commonly taught in South Africa. As technology gradually becomes more prevalent in classrooms (e.g., through smart boards, projectors, and educational apps), ClassCraft.AI offers educators a convenient solution for automating traditionally time-consuming tasks.

Technologies and Architecture:
Javascript, Typescript, CSS, Google Gemini AI API
The above mentioned technologies come together to perform various tasks such as recieving and saving prompts from users in order to provide data for the Google Gemini AI to perform various tasks and generations.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
